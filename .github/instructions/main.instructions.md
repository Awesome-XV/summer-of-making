Keep your changes as low impact as possible. You do not need to give me a summary of changes. You do not need to test the changes. Try to reference other parts of the codebase to ensure your changes are consistent with the existing code style and practices. Keep your responses concise and focused.

Read all context and instructions carefully before making changes. Do not suggest code that has been deleted or is no longer relevant.
